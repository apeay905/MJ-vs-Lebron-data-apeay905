__The Goat?__ This question has been brewing around ever since Lebron James won his first championship. Is Michael Jordan the greatest of all time or is Lebron James the greatest of all time? 

### __Motivation__
Since I was little, I have been watching sports, and basketball was one of my favorite. Unfortunately, my body has not been the kindest to me with sports related injuries(as I am doing this project, I am recovering from my 2nd Ankle Reconstruction surgery). From watching games or highlights, the question I have heard the most has been: Is Michael Jordan or Lebron James the greatest basketball player of all time.

I am most drawn to this subject due in fact that, I never got to see Michael Jordan play in person, as we are still currently watching Lebron James play out his career. So I trully want to know who is the GOAT!

### __Data Questions__

- As a percentgae of a team, were they individually scoring?
- Did teammates/opponents affect the individuals performance?
- Is there a difference maker between offensive and defensive effieceny?

### __MVP__
At the end of this project, I am hoping to find enough evidence to answer the question of Who's The Real MVP. That is by showing enough material to determine that outcome.
